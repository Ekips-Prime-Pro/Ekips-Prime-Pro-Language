## Installation

To use the Spike custom Programming Language, you need to install the compiler and runtime environment. Follow the instructions below to get started:

1. Download the latest version of the My Programming Language compiler from the official website.
2. Install the compiler on your system by running the installer.
3. Verify the installation by opening a terminal and running the `mypl --version` command.

## Syntax

The Spike custom  Programming Language has a simple and intuitive syntax that is easy to read and write. Here are some key features of the syntax:

- After evry Function you have to place a semicolon (`;`).
- The curly brackets define function uneque variables like `wait{1}` (`{}`).
- Comments can be added using the `//` or `/* */` syntax.

## Functions

The main functions of the Programming Language are for the basic use of the Spike Prime Custom Operating System and programming with ai enforced functions.
There are four build in functions.

- The `Drive` function is for driving a motorpair forward and backward.
- The `Tank` function is for making turns.
- The `Module` function is for controling a single motor.
- The `Calibration` function is for calibrating the robot and it motors, it also enhances the ai's capabilities.
- The `AI` function is for controling the artificial inteligence which is build in for evry module if there are datasets to build from.
- The `Sensor` function is for controling the Input for the artificial inteligence.
- The `Parallel` function will run multible thing simultanius.
- The `Wait` function will hold the programm for a few moments.
