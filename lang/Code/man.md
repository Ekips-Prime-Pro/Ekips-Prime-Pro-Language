2. Install the compiler on your system by running the installer.
3. Verify the installation by opening a terminal and running the `mypl --version` command.

## Syntax

My Programming Language has a simple and intuitive syntax that is easy to read and write. Here are some key features of the syntax:

- Statements are terminated with a semicolon (`;`).
- Blocks of code are enclosed in curly braces (`{}`).
- Comments can be added using the `//` or `/* */` syntax.

## Functions

The main functions of the compiler are for the basic use of the Spike Prime Custom Operating System.
There are four build in functions.

- The `Drive` function is for driving a motorpair forward and backward.
- The `Module` function is for controling a single motor.
- The `AI` function is for controling the artificial inteligence which is build in for evry module if there are datasets to build from.
- The `Sensor` function is for controling the Input for the artificial inteligence.
