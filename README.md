# Coding_lang_spike_PaRaMeRoS

The projekt is build for the FLL(First LEGO League) Community for better programming an ai enforced programm.

## Parts of the Projekt

1. [GUI Texeditor optimised for our own Programming language](#texteditor)
2. [Our own programming language](#programming-language)
3. [Compiler into llsp3 files and in a custom c file for our own spike operating system](#compiler)

## Programming language

### how to install

To use the Spike Custom System Programming LAnguage, you need to install the compiler and runtime environment. Follow the instructions below to get started:

1. Download the latest version of the Spike Custom System Programming Language compiler from the official website.
2. Install the compiler on your system by running the installer.
3. Verify the installation by opening a terminal and running the programm in cli mode command.

### How to use the scripting language

#### Syntax

The Spike Custom System Programming Language has a simple and intuitive syntax that is easy to read and write. Here are some key features of the syntax:

- After every Function you have to place a semicolon (`;`).
- The curly brackets define function uneque variables like `wait{1}` (`{}`).
- If you want to have to varables in curly brackets you have to add an colon (`:`)
- Comments can be added using the `//` or `/* */` syntax.

#### Functions

The main functions of the Spike Custom System Programming Language are for the basic use of the Spike Prime Custom Operating System and programming with ai enforced functions.
There are four build in functions.

- The `Drive` function is for driving a motorpair forward and backward.
- The `Tank` function is for making turns.
- The `Module` function is for controling a single motor.
- The `Calibration` function is for calibrating the robot and it motors, it also enhances the ai's capabilities.
- The `AI` function is for controling the artificial inteligence which is build in for every module if there are datasets to build from, for this there will be an extra Guide.
- The `Sensor` function is for controling the Input for the artificial inteligence.
- The `Parallel` function will run multible thing simultanius.
- The `Wait` function will hold the programm for a few moments.
- The `print` function will print any value you give it.

### Usefull side information

The best way to learn the language you have to remeber the syntax and the functions but then you have to practice. The following code examples will show you how to begin after you have try'd it you can open the Examples.md file and learn more about the Spike Custom System Programming Language.

1. `drive{10};` or `ai.drive{10};`
2. `module{100};` or `ai.module{100};`
3. `parallel{ai.drive{10}:module{100}};`
4. `sensor{color};`
5. `ai_train_data_save{data_file};` or `ai_train_data_load{data_file};` or `ai_model_chose{supervised_learning};`
6. `print{Hello World};`
7. `calibrate{10};` this will define the distance that will be driven.
8. `tank{90:30};`

## Compiler

<b>Disclaimer: If you use the llsp3 compiler mode you can't use the function `parallel()` !!!</b>

### How to best and most efficiently use the compiler

### Some things that will be added in the future

## Operating system

The OS is a custom build <b>ARM32</b> based system for the Spike Prime. It is build for the Spike Custom System Programming Language and the Spike Custom System Programming Language Compiler. The Operating system is build for the best use of the Spike Prime and the Spike Custom System Programming Language. The Spike Custom System Programming Language and the Spike Custom System Programming Language Compiler <b>is a part</b> of the Operating system. [More information](https://github.com/)
